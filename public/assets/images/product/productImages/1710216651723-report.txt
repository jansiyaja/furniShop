To make things easier, there's now a wallet feature for users, especially if their orders get canceled. and  returned the  products.  i have also made sure to clearly explain the payment rules to users.

 Alerts keep admins informed about important events like canceled orders or profile changes. Searching for things is easier with advanced options for sorting. The user profiles now look better, and there's a way to reset passwords if users forget them.

Apart from the project, I've been working on improving my typing skills. I've also learned about habits and how our brains work with rewards. Understanding this helps me make the e-commerce platform more engaging. I've even created a video seminar talking about how important technology is for students' careers. It explains how tech helps in learning and growing skills. These activities together make my learning and project experience more interesting and useful. aprt from that these are the some parts in the atomic habits by james clear in his second chapter The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive
